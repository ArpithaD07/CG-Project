# CG-Project
Computer Graphics Project on Helicopter Game Using Visual Stdio C++

A 2d graphics based game helicopter is a great start for a student who starts learning
computer graphics & visualization. The development of the game has large scope to
learn computer graphics from scratch. We used OpenGL utility toolkit to implement
the algorithm, written it in c++ language.

 There is still scope left in the development of project like, after“game over”
a list should show top ten scorers, a need to embed a button “play again”. Welcome
screen need more modification there is scope of embedding buttons like “about”,
“how to play”, “configuration”, “profiles”, etc. In future we hope we would
implement it in source code for better experience of playing this game.

 Finally, we could say by developing the game we have learnt the basics of f
computer graphics and in future by developing it further we shall learn more. It will
be our pleasure if we could develop in 3d graphics package.
